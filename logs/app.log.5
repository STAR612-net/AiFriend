2024-08-05 20:14:44,352 INFO: Updated session messages: [{'content': '"Frozen" is a beloved Disney animated movie that was released in 2013. The film is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen\'s fairy tale "The Snow Queen," but it has its own unique twist and charm.\n\nThe story takes place in the kingdom of Arendelle, where Princess Elsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) has been born with the magical power to create ice and snow. As she grows older, Elsa struggles to control her powers, which often result in unintentional snowstorms and icy blasts that can be quite destructive.\n\nElsa\'s fear of hurting those around her leads her to isolate herself from the rest of the kingdom, including her sister Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell). Anna is a free-spirited princess who loves her sister dearly but doesn\'t understand why Elsa has become so distant.\n\nThe story takes a dramatic turn when Elsa\'s powers are accidentally revealed to the public during her coronation as the queen. Panic sets in, and Elsa runs away, fearing for everyone\'s safety. This leads to a lifelong winter that plunges Arendelle into eternal darkness and cold.\n\nAnna sets out on a journey to find her sister and convince her to return and reverse the curse. Along the way, she meets Kristoff (voiced by Jonathan Groff), an ice harvester who is accompanied by his loyal reindeer Sven. They are joined by Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad), a lovable snowman brought to life by Elsa\'s magic.\n\nThe movie features stunning animation, memorable characters, and catchy music. The soundtrack includes the hit songs "Let It Go," "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?," and "For the First Time in Forever." The film\'s themes of sisterly love, self-acceptance, and embracing one\'s unique qualities have resonated with audiences worldwide.\n\n"Frozen" was a massive commercial success, grossing over $1.2 billion at the box office and becoming the highest-grossing animated film of all time upon its release. It also won numerous awards, including two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song ("Let It Go"). The movie\'s popularity led to the creation of a successful franchise, with sequels, short films, and merchandise that have become beloved by fans of all ages.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'Tell us about ¡®Frozen.¡¯', 'role': 'user'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'I think there may be some confusion here!\n\nThe movie "Frozen" is actually a Disney animated film released in 2013, not directed by Bong Joon-ho.\n\nBong Joon-ho is a South Korean film director, producer, and screenwriter known for his critically acclaimed films that often explore themes of social class, family dynamics, and the human condition.
