For our Chicken McNuggets, we have a few options on the menu. We've got the 4-piece, 6-piece, or 10-piece packs. Would you like to try those with any dipping sauce?

We also have some signature sandwiches like the McChicken, which is a crispy chicken filet sandwich served on a toasted bun.

If you're looking for something a bit different, we've got our Signature Crafted Sandwiches menu, where you can build your own burger with toppings of your choice. We've got options like grilled chicken, crispy bacon, and fresh lettuce.

So, what sounds good to you? [in C:\project\sesac\aiFriend\app\ai_chat.py:45]
