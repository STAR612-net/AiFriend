In Isaac Asimov's novel "Foundation", the main character is not a single individual, but rather a collective entity: the Foundation itself. However, if we're looking for a central figure around which the story revolves, it would be:

**Hari Seldon**

Hari Seldon is a mathematician and psychohistorian who predicts the impending collapse of the Galactic Empire, which has ruled for 12,000 years. He founds the Foundation on the planet Terminus, with the goal of preserving human civilization and rebuilding society after the predicted collapse.

Seldon is a brilliant scientist, but also a passionate advocate for humanity's future. He creates the Psychohistorical Branch of the Galactic Museum to develop a new field of mathematics that can predict the course of human history. Through his work, he predicts that the next 1,000 years will be marked by chaos and darkness, but also sees an opportunity for humanity to rebuild and create a new society.

While Hari Seldon is not directly involved in the events of the novel, his legacy and vision drive the story forward, as the Foundation's leaders and scientists work to fulfill his predictions and build a better future. [in C:\project\sesac\aiFriend\app\ai_chat.py:79]
