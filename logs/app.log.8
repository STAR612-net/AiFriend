2024-08-05 19:59:29,130 INFO: Updated session messages: [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': '"Frozen" is a beloved Disney animated film that was released in 2013. The movie tells the story of two sisters, Elsa and Anna, who live in the kingdom of Arendelle.\n\nElsa (voiced by Idina Menzel) has been born with the magical power to create and control ice and snow. As she grows older, Elsa becomes increasingly isolated and withdrawn, afraid of hurting those around her with her powers. Her parents, the king and queen, try to help her learn to control her abilities, but they ultimately decide to keep her powers a secret from the rest of the kingdom.\n\nAnna (voiced by Kristen Bell) is a free-spirited and optimistic young woman who loves her sister dearly. She\'s determined to help Elsa overcome her fears and live openly as the princess she was meant to be.\n\nHowever, things take a dramatic turn when Elsa\'s powers are revealed to the public on the day of her coronation as the new queen. In her fear and panic, Elsa inadvertently plunges Arendelle into eternal winter, causing chaos and destruction throughout the kingdom.\n\nAnna sets out on a journey to find her sister and convince her to return and reverse the curse. Along the way, she meets Kristoff (voiced by Jonathan Groff), an outdoorsy mountain man who helps her on her quest, as well as his loyal reindeer Sven and a talking snowman named Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad).\n\n"Frozen" features stunning animation, memorable characters, and a soundtrack that includes the hit song "Let It Go," which became a global phenomenon. The film\'s themes of sisterly love, acceptance, and self-discovery have resonated with audiences around the world.\n\nThe movie was a massive commercial success, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also received widespread critical acclaim, earning two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song ("Let It Go").\n\nIn 2019, "Frozen" got its own sequel, "Frozen II," which continued the adventures of Elsa, Anna, and their friends in Arendelle. The franchise has since expanded to include short films, TV specials, and merchandise, cementing its place as one of Disney\'s most beloved and enduring franchises.'}] [in C:\project\sesac\aiFriend\app\ai_chat.py:21]
