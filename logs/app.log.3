In Isaac Asimov's novel "Foundation", the main character is not a single individual, but rather a collective entity: the Foundation itself. However, if we're looking for a central figure around which the story revolves, it would be:

**Hari Seldon**

Hari Seldon is a mathematician and psychohistorian who predicts the impending collapse of the Galactic Empire, which has ruled for 12,000 years. He founds the Foundation on the planet Terminus, with the goal of preserving human civilization and rebuilding society after the predicted collapse.

Seldon is a brilliant scientist, but also a passionate advocate for humanity's future. He creates the Psychohistorical Branch of the Galactic Museum to develop a new field of mathematics that can predict the course of human history. Through his work, he predicts that the next 1,000 years will be marked by chaos and darkness, but also sees an opportunity for humanity to rebuild and create a new society.

While Hari Seldon is not directly involved in the events of the novel, his legacy and vision drive the story forward, as the Foundation's leaders and scientists work to fulfill his predictions and build a better future. [in C:\project\sesac\aiFriend\app\ai_chat.py:77]
2024-08-09 22:39:58,260 INFO: assistant: The main character of Isaac Asimov's novel "Foundation" is not a single individual, but rather a collective entity: **the Foundation itself**.

The Foundation is a group of scientists and engineers who are tasked with preserving human knowledge and culture in the face of an impending global catastrophe. They are founded by Harry Seldon, a mathematician and psychohistorian who predicts the collapse of the Galactic Empire.

The novel follows the story of the Foundation as it evolves from a small group of scholars to a powerful organization that seeks to preserve human civilization and rebuild society after the predicted collapse of the empire.

Throughout the book, the Foundation is personified through its various leaders and members, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. However, there is no single main character who drives the plot forward. Instead, the story explores the collective efforts of the Foundation's members as they work to achieve Seldon's vision for a new society.
