I just had the best day ever at the zoo, and I can't wait to tell you all about it. My mom, dad, and I got up early to make sure we arrived right when it opened. I was so excited that I could hardly eat my breakfast! The first animals we saw were the lions. They were super big and had huge manes. One of the lions even let out a big roar! It was a little scary but also really cool. I think they must have been hungry because it was almost lunchtime. Next, we went to see the elephants. They were my favorite! I love how they have such long trunks and big, floppy ears."}] [in C:\project\sesac\aiFriend\app\ai_chat.py:63]
